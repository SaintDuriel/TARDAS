Yet Another Test Automation Framework Java-TestNG-Appium/Selenium

Modular Test Automation Framework where each module has a single responsibility. 

Heavily influenced by Doctor Who, so many of the module names may not make sense immediately, but the overall naming convention aligns with their functionality. 

Lots to read in here, and ultimately this should be seperate git projects, but at this time I'm still learning how to do MODULES.... So it is what you get. 

Please feel free to download, and attempt to run the TemplateTest within the Console Module src/test/java/testCases/SearchTests.java
